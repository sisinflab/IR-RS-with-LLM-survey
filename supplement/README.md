## Raw Citation Score Analysis from Google Scholar

While the main paper focuses on age-normalized citation scores to measure the velocity and sustained impact of research, the raw, un-normalized citation data offers a complementary perspective on the absolute influence of papers published in a given year. This section presents the figures and interpretation of these raw scores.

*Note: On the left we have trends about the IR domain. On the right, what concerns the RSs domain.*

The raw citation data adds nuance to the *tri-partite era* identified in our main analysis, particularly by highlighting the absolute impact of foundational works and the dynamics of the early transitional period.

A key insight revealed with exceptional clarity by the raw data is the dramatic citation peak for RS papers in *2019*. While the normalized score in the main paper identifies this as a period of high-velocity work, the raw score underscores the sheer volume of influence these publications have had. This peak strongly suggests that the work published in this specific year represents a foundational and essential step in the domain, producing cornerstone papers that have become critical references for nearly all subsequent research.

In contrast to the RS trend, the raw citation data for the IR domain reveals a subtle but important difference from the normalized analysis. We observe an initial, slight decrease in raw citation totals for the early years of the LLM era. This trend, which is smoothed out by normalization, may be interpreted as a potential shift in researcher interests. It could signify a brief period where the community pivoted away from older, established IR paradigms without yet fully coalescing around the new LLM-centric ones, temporarily lowering the absolute citation impact of the work produced.

For the most recent years, the behavior of the raw citation score and the normalized citation score is largely identical. This is an expected outcome due to the nature of the normalization metric, as detailed [here](../README.md#normalized-citation-score). For papers published very recently, the denominator of the normalization formula is close to 1. Therefore, the high raw citation counts for this period directly reflect the immediate and significant impact of the latest research, confirming the consecration of the LLM era in both fields.
