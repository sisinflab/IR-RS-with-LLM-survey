# Analysis of Publication Trends and Distributions

This directory contains the figures presented in our survey, which provide empirical evidence for the convergence of Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). Below, we offer a more detailed narrative and interpretation for each figure.

## Distribution of Publications Across Taxonomy Subtopics

This figure presents a static snapshot of the total research output, distributed across the taxonomy categories for both IR and RS. The bar plots allow for a direct comparison of where the research community has invested its efforts, revealing a clear story of historical divergence and modern convergence.
